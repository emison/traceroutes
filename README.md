USAGE
traceroutes [network interface (usually eth0 or wlan0)]

DESCRIPTION
Traceroutes is a simple command line utility that leverages arp-scan and traceroute to find devices on the local network. Most command line utilities require many arguments and a fair amount of experience to use effectively. Traceroutes only needs a network interface to find every device on the network and list the host names and ip addresses.

DISCLAIMER
The program is relatively new and I haven't tried it on any machines but my own so there may be bugs that I don't know about. I would be glad to learn about these as I expand the functionality.
